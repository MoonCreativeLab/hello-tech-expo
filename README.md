# Hello Tech: Expo

This repo follows the tutorial at https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/.

Follow the installation instructions under Getting Started, and then move to the Tutorial section.

For this repo, we used a 'blank' project template (when you initialize the project, you will be prompted to pick a base project).

This repo has a separate branch for each section of the tutorial in case something goes wrong.
